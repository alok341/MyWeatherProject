## 🧪 Features

- 🌎 Get weather for any city using OpenWeatherMap API  
- 🌡️ Temperature, humidity, wind speed, condition, and more  
- 🕒 Shows **local time** of the city using timezone offset  
- 🌥️ Weather condition icons (clear, rain, clouds, etc.)  
- 🧠 Search history saved in `localStorage`  
- ⚡ Loading screen during data fetch  
- 📱 Responsive design for all screen sizes
